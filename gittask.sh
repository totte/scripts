# gittask.sh: taskbased git branching utility

# This script requires that git has been installed and properly configured,
# that the remote "master" and "development" branches exist (locally too) 
# and that a network connection to the "origin" repository is established.
# It also requires that you have a GPG private key to sign tags.
